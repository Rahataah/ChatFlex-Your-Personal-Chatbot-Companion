## 🛠️ Features

- **Image Upload**: Upload PNGs, JPGs, or GIFs to ask questions about visuals—great for analyzing memes or diagrams!
- **Chat History**: Your conversation stays in view, so you can pick up where you left off.
- **Error Handling**: Graceful error messages keep you in the loop if something goes awry.
- **Responsive Design**: Looks great on any device, thanks to Streamlit’s wide layout.

## 💻 Tech Stack

- **Streamlit**: For the slick, interactive frontend.
- **OpenRouter API**: Connects to a variety of free AI models for text and image processing.
- **Python**: The backbone of the app, with libraries like `openai`, `base64`, and `io` for handling API calls and images.

## 🚀 Pro Tips

- **Experiment with Models**: Each AI has a unique style—try Google Gemma 3 for techy answers or Qwen 2.5 VL for image-based chats.
- **Image Questions**: Upload a photo and ask something specific, like “What’s the vibe of this sunset?” or “Describe this chart.”
- **Rerun for Variety**: If the response isn’t quite right, rerunning can give you a different perspective.
- **Keep Your API Key Safe**: Don’t share it publicly, as it’s your ticket to free AI goodness.

## 🐛 Known Quirks

- **Image Persistence**: The app doesn’t clear uploaded images automatically after a chat, so you might need to manually remove them for new prompts (a “Clear Image” button is on the wishlist!).
- **Model Limits**: Free OpenRouter models have usage caps, so check their site for details.
- **Rerun Button Scope**: The rerun button only appears on the latest assistant response to keep things tidy.
